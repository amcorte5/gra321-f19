    <h1> The Grand Canyon</h1>
    <h4> The Grand Canyon is in Northwestern Arizona. It is 277 miles long, and in some areas it is 18 miles wide, because it is 1 mile further down than the rest of the world you may think that there is not very much going on down there but there is, and it is actually a lot more of a habitat to many animals than lots of other places. The Grand Canyon was formed by erosion. The Colorado river runs through the middle of the Grand Canyon. The average air temperature is lower at the rim of the canyon than it is way down at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. The canyon has 2 rims, the north rim and the south rim. People are so interested in the grand canyon that they have built a skywalk with a glass bottom which is totally safe for others to walk out up to 70 feet on. This means that we can all see the grand canyon without having to go in a helicopter. Some animals living in the grand canyon include mountain lions, red tailed hawks, and elk. These animals are not alone though lots of the animals that inhabit the grand canyon work together and live in symbiotic relationships with other animals.</h4>
